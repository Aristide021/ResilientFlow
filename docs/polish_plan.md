```

## Environment Flags Strategy

Using environment flags for easy deployment:
- `USE_MOCK=1` (default) - Mock implementations for demo
- `USE_MOCK=0` - Live cloud services  
- `SLACK_URL` - Slack webhook for live alerts
- `TWILIO_AUTH` - Twilio for SMS alerts
- `VISUALIZER_URL` - Real-time visualization endpoint

## Fast-Lane Tips Applied

- ✅ Environment flags over code branches
- ✅ Short log strings with TRACE prefixes
- ✅ Modular architecture for easy integration
- ✅ Working baseline to build upon
